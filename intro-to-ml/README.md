# Introduction to Machine Learning: A Hands-on Workshop for Beginners

## Description

Are you curious about machine learning and how it applies to medical research? In this workshop, you will gain hands-on experience approaching research question using machine learning methods, with a focus on the Python data science ecosystem. No previous experience necessary.

## Workshop materials

Our workshop will feature two Jupyter Notebooks. We encourage learners to use the Google Colab environment to interact with the Notebooks (you can download and run Jupyter locally as well).

Google Colab is able to ingest a notebook file (*.ipynb) and run a copy within your Google Colab environment. To do this, simply follow the links below:

[Part One: Introduction & Classification with Scikit-learn (link to load in Google Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/arcus/education-materials/blob/master/intro-to-ml/ml_workbook_00_intro.ipynb)

[Part two: Validation, Tuning, and Model Selection](https://colab.research.google.com/github/arcus/education-materials/blob/master/intro-to-ml/ml_workbook_01_validation_tuning.ipynb)

## Further resources

Keep studying with this [Google Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)

Please note the workbook for today are loosely based on the following two repos:

[Jake Vanderplas' Scikit-learn tutorial](https://github.com/jakevdp/sklearn_tutorial/)
[Andreas Müller's Introduction to Machine learning with Python workshop](https://github.com/amueller/ml-workshop-1-of-4)

Both are great resources for further exploration! Also consider Müller's [supervised learning notebook](https://github.com/amueller/introduction_to_ml_with_python/blob/master/02-supervised-learning.ipynb) for a more granual exploration of KNN.
